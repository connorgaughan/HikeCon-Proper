WordPress Starter Theme
==============

Starkers + Sassparilla + The Semantic Grid System
--------------

Created from the master version of Elliot Jay Stocks & Keir Whitaker's [Starkers](http://starkerstheme.com). 
This version utlizes [Sassparilla](http://sass.fffunction.co/) in conjunction with the [Semantic Grid System](http://semantic.gs/) for rapid developement.

I use this as the base for all my WordPress development. Although, adding Sassparilla in the mix does add some basic styling to the nearly naked Starkers theme I believe the good outweighs the bad.
